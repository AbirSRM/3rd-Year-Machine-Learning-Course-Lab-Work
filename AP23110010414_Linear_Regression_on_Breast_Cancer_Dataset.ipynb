Linear regression is typically used for continuous target variables.\n","*   Given the nature of the target variable, a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest) would be a more appropriate choice for this problem. Evaluating the performance of classification models using relevant metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC) would provide a more suitable assessment of the model's ability to predict breast cancer diagnosis.\n"]}]}
